## Introduction

### Hello this is my intro to me!

 My name is Chace Suchintamai and I'm in 10th grade. I have Thai and Chinese heritage dating from probably thousands of years. I have two siblings: a younger brother who is eight and and older sister who is twenty four. My favorite movie or rather movie series is Cars because I just loved watching Lightning McQueen as a little kid. I always enjoyed seeing the race scenes, especially that big crash in the beginning of Cars 1.  Some other series that I like to watch are Dexter, Young Sheldon, You, and etc. I am always open to watch new series or shows that come out or are interesting. 

 Some unique facts about me are that I love swim. When I mean I love swimming, I mean that I usually try to go swim 5-6 days a week for around 2-3 hours. I started when I was four but I never swam competitvely in a swim team unti last year. I'm happy that I have improved my time for a 50m freestyle from 35.67 seconds to 29.91 seconds. Some new skills I want to learn are how to cook some delicious meals and skateboarding. I also wanna learn how to code more with different languages. Honestly anything new and fun is cool with me. 

 I've already mentioned that I do swimming, but I also do long distance running. Slowly but surely, my cardiovascular endurance has been getting improving
