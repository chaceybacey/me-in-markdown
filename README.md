## Introduction

 My name is Chace Suchintamai and I'm in 10th grade. I have Thai and Chinese heritage dating from probably thousands of years. I have two siblings: a younger brother who is eight and and older sister who is twenty four. My favorite movie or rather movie series is Cars because I just loved watching Lightning McQueen as a little kid.

Some other series that I like to watch are Dexter, Young Sheldon, You, and etc. I am always open to watch new series or shows that come out or are interesting.

Some new skills I want to learn are how to cook some delicious meals and skateboarding. I also wanna learn how to code more with different languages. Honestly anything new and fun is cool with me. My favorite memory over the summer was when I hung out with two OG best friends. One of them came over from Colorado and we did a bunch of stuff for a week before he had to go back.

 I've already mentioned that I do swimming, but I also do long distance running. Slowly but surely, my cardiovascular endurance has been getting improving! Video games that I play are Minecraft, Roblox, and Marvel Rivals. I used to play Valorant for threeish years, but I decided to quit the game. One fun fact about Valorant is that a Riot employee once came to my parents' restaurant saw me playing. He gave me a Riot Buddy, which is an exclusive gun buddy that you can only get from an employee. I've probably also spent too much money on that game on skins.
